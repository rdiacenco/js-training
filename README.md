## Objective
The objective is to create a game that proposes a word which the user should guess.
The user will enter one letter at a time and the program will either fill in the
letter in all the places where it matches and will update the score or will
decrement the number of tries.
When the word has been guessed it will print a success message with the score.
When the number of tries has been exceeded it will print a fail message.
